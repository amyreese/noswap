On Saturday, I appeared as a guest host on [Podcast 17][], for the interview portion of
[episode #128][pc17aside], to talk about the benefits and challenges of creating open source
modifications for Valve's Source engine, the power behind their classic Half Life 2 series. It got
rather sidetracked from the original plan of discussion, and ran longer than expected, but there
was some interesting discussion, and great insight from former Valve contractor Tony Sergi.

If you work on the Source engine, or are looking to run or join open source mod projects, I highly
recommend you take the time to listen in.
