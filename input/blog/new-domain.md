description: LeetCode.net will now be redirecting to me new domain, NoSwap.com

For multiple reasons, I've decided to move away from using my LeetCode.net domain for my online
identity and begin using NoSwap.com instead.  I will be slowing moving over my sites and
applications, and will make sure to set up 301 permanent redirects or other forwarding methods as
necessary to make sure nothing gets orphaned for the forseeable future.

As for the actual reasoning behind the move, it stems from multiple issues I had with the old
domain, such as:

*	Being able to pronounce my email address and domain to the general public without having to
	always spell it out and make sure they catch that there are two e's in the domain.
	
*	Switching at the same time from jreese@ to john@ for my address also means I don't have to
	worry about people misspelling my last name, which happens so much even my own family still
	gets it wrong on a regular basis.

*	Not having to explain what "leet" is, or getting remarks about it being a juvenile choice
	due to the stigma of "leetspeak".

*	It's a short .com domain, so that people will get it right every time; I've had people assume
	I actually meant leetcode.com, without confirming it before sending a doomed message...

Anyways, in the off chance that you're a sentient being, and actually reading this, if you happen
to catch an error or gap in my redirection efforts, please drop a line to john@ this domain.
