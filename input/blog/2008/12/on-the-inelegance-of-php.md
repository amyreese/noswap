As a well-seasoned PHP developer for <a href="http://www.mantisbt.org">MantisBT</a>
and other projects, but at the same time a seasoned developer in Python, C++, Lua,
etc, I found this interesting article on Hacker News,
<a href="http://phpadvent.org/2008/yet-by-marco-tabini"><em>Yet</em></a>, a short
piece on the "history" and development of PHP as a language.

A few choice quotes that I most enjoyed:

<blockquote>I don't know anyone who programs in PHP and hasn't ... become much more
acquainted with the concept of "haystack" and "needle" than any one person should have
to in a lifetime.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With time, an experienced developer learns that the only reason why any
particular functionality is not in PHP is that it's not there &mdash; <em>yet</em>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Invariably, PHP developers who try to settle into a framework have the
(often irresistible) urge to simply drop it and write their own, because, you see,
there is no framework that does things the way he or she wants &mdash; <em>yet</em>.</blockquote>

I really like working on the PHP projects that I'm a part of, but every time I write a
Python script to do something, it just reminds me of how <em>unsophisticated</em> PHP
really is as a language.  Perhaps that's OK;  it certainly hasn't stopped me... <em>yet</em>.
