The past two months have been intense.  At the beginning of May, I was let go
from BioWare and Electronic Arts in a round of budget cuts for my studio.
Since then, I've played far too many video games (and beaten beaten multiple
titles), slogged through inumerable interviews, redesigned my website from the
ground up, and celebrated my seventh wedding anniversary during some of the
best summer weather I've ever experienced.

**Oh, and I got a job at Facebook.**

May 3rd, I thought my terrible luck had struck again.  But this time was
different; within a few days a recruiter from Facebook reached out to me, and
encouraged me to apply for an engineering role.  Four weeks later, after phone
screens and an on-site interview, I was offered a position as a Production
Engineer.  My luck had not only reversed, it has gone off the scale in the
opposite direction.

Alongside Facebook, all my other leads paled in comparison.  I wanted to stay
in gaming , but here was the opportunity of a lifetime: to join one of the
biggest and best engineering companies in the world, and the chance to learn
from some of the brightest minds in the industry.  It was an offer I couldn't
refuse.

Monday was my orientation, and I was immediately impressed by the level of
vision, passion and dedication from the entire team.  The culture of "hack"
is prevalent throughout the company, even outside of the engineers, and it
feels amazing to be part of a company that's out to change the world and
improve the lives of millions of people.  Our core values include "move fast",
"be bold" and, most importantly, "build social value".

Even the training process embodies the same ideals.  The first few weeks,
every engineer goes through "bootcamp", attending learning and development
sessions, sitting among other bootcamp engineers, and working with veteran
employees on real tasks to get familiar with many parts of the infrastructure
and codebase, before talking to teams with openings and deciding which one
best aligns with the engineer's strengths, goals, and interests.

Wednesday was the first day at my desk.  Taped to my monitor was a sheet of
paper printed with bold, red lettering.

> What would you do if you weren't afraid?

I still don't have an answer for that.
