I've just reached the 1000 commit milestone as recorded by <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/accounts/nuclear_eclipse">my Ohloh profile</a>.  By far, most of them are related to my work on the MantisBT project and associated plugins.

Now if only I could find a job local to Cincinnati...  If you are interested in hiring me, or know someone who's looking for an open source developer, take a look at <a href="http://johnmreese.com/resume">my resume</a>.
