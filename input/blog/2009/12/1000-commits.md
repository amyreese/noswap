I've just reached the 1000 commit milestone as recorded by [my Ohloh profile][1].
By far, most of them are related to my work on the MantisBT project and
associated plugins.

Now if only I could find a job local to Cincinnati...  If you are interested
in hiring me, or know someone who's looking for an open source developer, take
a look at [my resume][2].
