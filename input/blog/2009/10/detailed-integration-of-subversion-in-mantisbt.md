Chris Dornfeld at [Unitz][1] has an excellent, [detailed overview][2] of the
options available when importing Subversion repositories into MantisBT using
my Source Integration framework.  My [previous article][3] on the topic fails
to go into particulars with SVN repositories, mainly because many of the
options weren't even dreamed of at the time, let alone implemented.

Anyways, the information and explanations presented in his article are pretty
accurate.  Until I can get the time to fully document the SVN and Git plugins,
or the framework as a whole, consider Chris's post to be canonical information.

Cheers
