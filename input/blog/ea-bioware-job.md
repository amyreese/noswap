Last week, I received an offer from EA BioWare:  they want me to join their San Francisco
operations team as a Platform Systems Engineer!  I still can't believe that this is happening,
but I'm going to be moving to California to work for a game studio.  This is practically my
dreams come true, and I'm excited and overwhelmed beyond my imagination.

I won't be working on games directly, but I'll be working in a devops role to automate and
manage servers for games and internal projects.  It's a good fit with my experience in web
applications, system administration, and tool development.  It also can be a potential
stepping stone to a game development position later on.

The next two months are likely to be hectic, as I move to temporary housing in California,
and then find an apartment and move into it.  Ongoing projects may have to take a back seat
until I can get the free time again.  But the weather and job will be worth it!
