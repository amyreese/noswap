Yesterday evening, I received sorrowful news.  My neighbor had passed away in her sleep, to the surprise
of everyone who knew her.  An active grandmother, her personality exuded a quiet energy, a presence that
brightened your day and made you smile.  The loss is palpable.

Rest in peace, Joyce.  You will be missed.
