Yesterday, my wife and I visited the [National Museum of the United States Air Force](http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/)
at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio.  We walked through the three main hangars, mostly in chronological order.
I snapped a lot of pictures along the way with my Nexus S; I picked out the blurry duplicates where possible, and
captioned the photos as best I could.  They actually turned out better than expected, considering the low light
levels and how unsteady my arms got.

I didn't get to take pictures of the [XB-70](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_XB-70_Valkyrie) like I
wanted to though; it was in their Research and Development hangar, which requires an ID check and bus ride to visit.
Hopefully we'll get to return soon and rectify that.

and contains 130 photos.
