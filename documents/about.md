title: About Me
---
I am a professional Software Engineer with experience in creating web applications using a
variety of languages, frameworks, and technologies.  I have a Bachelor of Science degree in
Software Engineering from the [Rochester Institute of Technology][rit] in Rochester, NY.
I now live near San Francisco, California with my wonderful wife Angela and an adorable pair
of cats named Skittle and Zero.

I have been using and promoting Linux and open source software since late 2003, and I have become
a firm believer in the merits of free/libre software. I contribute to various open source software
projects, such as the [Mantis Bug Tracker][mantisbt], and spread knowledge and information about
free software whenever I get the chance.
