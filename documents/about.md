title: About Me
---
I am a professional software engineer with a wide range of experience in
creating and supporting applications and the infrastructure they run on, using
a variety of languages, frameworks, and technologies.  I've had the opportunity
to learn and grow in multiple sectors of the industry, including
telecommunications, network security, video games, and social networking.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from the
[Rochester Institute of Technology][rit] in Rochester, New York.
I now live in the sunny San Francisco Bay Area, in California, with my wonderful
wife Angela and an adorable pair of cats named Skittle and Zero.

I have been using and promoting Linux and open source software since late 2003,
and I am a firm believer in the merits of free/libre software in professional
software. I contribute to various open source software projects, and I like to
share my passion and excitement for free software whenever I get the chance.

In my free time, I'm an avid video game enthusiast, with a love for space, sci-fi
settings, and open worlds with great narratives.  Some of my all-time favorites
include [Mass Effect][], [Kerbal Space Program][], [X3][], and
[Elite Dangerous][].  I've dabbled with creating games in the past, but have too
much fun playing them to leave time for making them.
