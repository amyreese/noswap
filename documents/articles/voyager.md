When I was in elementary school, I discovered a series of books in the library
that detailed, in glorious full page color, photos of the outer solar system as
captured by Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 on their epic journeys to places never
before explored by humanity. I was so stunned and enthralled at the thoughts
of visiting those distant worlds; it indeed captured my imagination, and
continues to inspire me even now, two decades after I first learned of their
amazing quests.

I've spent countless hours dreaming of visiting the planets and stars of our
universe: in games like Wing Commander, Freespace, [Freelancer][],
[Mass Effect][], and [X3][], exploring fictional galaxies, and in
[Orbiter Sim][], recreating my own journeys to the planets and moons of our own
solar system. I can't wait for [Star Citizen][] and [X Rebirth][] to give me
further ways to escape the confines of Earth and experience worlds that
I will never be able to visit otherwise.

And I have NASA to thank for inspiring so many of these wonderful outlets, from
the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo projects that took us to the Moon, the Voyager
missions for showing us just how beautiful our own back yard really is, to
the Mars rovers for exploring our closest neighbor, and to future NASA
missions like [New Horizons][] that are leading the way towards understanding
our tiny place in this vast universe.

Today, it was finally confirmed that Voyager 1 has indeed crossed the boundary
of the heliosphere and [forever left our solar system behind][nytimes].

Wow.

I simply find it incredible that not only is Voyager still working after four
decades of exceptional service, but that it's still capable of aiming its
antennas at Earth, sending a coherent signal using only 23W of power, and
actually sending useful data back to us. That alone is a hugely amazing
achievement, and I think everyone at NASA should be eternally proud of their
accomplishment. The fact that we now have even more data points regarding the
boundaries of our solar system is just pure icing on top of that cake, and I
congratulate everyone involved in the project.

If you asked me what my favorite spacecraft is, fictional or not, it wouldn't
be the Enterprise, the Millenium Falcon, the Normandy, or even the Apollo
rockets; it would be Voyager. And it will forever hold a special place in my
heart.

So thank you, NASA. Thank you.
