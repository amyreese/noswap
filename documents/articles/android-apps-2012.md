Eighteen months ago, I wrote an article about my [Favorite Android Apps][faa],
but a lot has changed with Android and its app ecosystem since then.  Developers
have started putting more focus on design and usability when creating apps, and
of course newer apps have come along that I have come to rely upon.  I myself
have upgraded to newer devices, with a Nexus 7 replacing my Galaxy Tab 10.1,
and a Galaxy Nexus from work has sadly replaced my beloved but aging Nexus S.

So what follows are some of my favorite new apps, and some follow-up on what my
previous favorite apps look like in modern attire.  All screenshots are taken
from devices running Android 4.2.1 (CM 10.1 nightlies).

-   **[Press][press-app]** - $2

    While I used to use Shaun Inman's excellent newsreader [Fever][], during my
    efforts to purge my server of all things PHP, it had to go.  I exported my
    feeds to [Google Reader][], and have been quite happy with their solid web
    interface.  The Android experience, on the other hand, is spartan and dated.
    There are numerous third party clients that try to improve upon the Reader
    experience, but most have problems of their own, either in looks, features,
    or user interaction.  That's where Press shines.

    Sneaking into 2012 near the end of December, Press boasts first class app
    design, with a good reading flow that's gotten even better with the recent
    1.1 update.  Press features three primary views that you swipe between:
    a list of your various feeds if you prefer to read everything or just an
    individual news feed, a list of articles, and the article itself; swiping
    left and right moves between these views, and subtle buttons at the bottom
    of the article view allow you to jump between articles.

    With a combination of stunning UI and great interaction, this app is a
    total steal for anyone who frequently gets their news from RSS feeds.

-   **[Instapaper][instapaper-app]** - $3

    In the last review, my favorite "save for later" app was Read It Later,
    which has since been rebranded as [Pocket][], though I commented at the time
    that I had wished that [Instapaper][] could have been a contender.  Since
    then, Instapaper officially released an Android client, and I jumped at the
    chance to try it out.  It's an excellent app, and I think it's both simpler
    and cleaner than the competition; a good match for their web interface, and
    my favorite way to read long articles.  My only complaint is that I'm not
    fond of the font choice for the article list.

-   **[Reddit Is Fun][reddit-app]** - Free with $2 premium features

    One of my favorite time wasters, when I don't feel like reading, is browsing
    the wonderfully terrible r/pics and r/aww.  While Reddit's mobile website
    is decidely subpar, Reddit Is Fun has brought the time wasting to Android
    in a simple, well-designed package.  It has plenty of options for
    customizing the look and behavior of the app, what subreddits are shown by
    default, and more.  I'm unconvinced by the premium features, but I was more
    than happy to support the developers of such a solid app.

-   **[Locale][locale-app]** - $5

    I've probably talked [more about Locale](/blog/locale) than any other app
    for Android, but it's always worth repeating, and it just keeps getting
    better and better.  Having a phone that's smart enough to adapt to my daily
    routine is liberating.  I never need to worry about setting my phone to
    silent when I get to work, I'm never bothered when I'm trying to sleep, and
    I never miss a call because I forgot to turn my ringer back on;  Locale just
    takes care of all that for me.  It's so much easier to use than all of its
    competitors, and it's worth every penny.

-   **[Pocket Casts][pocketcasts-app]** - $3

	[Doggcatcher][doggcatcher-app]

-   **[Spotify][spotify-app]** - Free with paid subscription

    Where [Pandora][] was my music app of choice for the last review, Spotify
    has stolen my loyalty by combining on-demand music from an extremely large
    library with trainable radio stations that rival even Pandora's excellent
    algorithms.  The desktop application actually works really well, and the
    first-class integration with local mp3 files, coupled with the ability to
    sync playlists between the desktop and mobile apps, leaves me with no other
    credible choice.  This is truly the best way to listen to music in the
    modern age.

-   **[Dropbox][dropbox-app]** - Free

    Since the last review, [Dropbox][] has added automatic uploading of photos
    to your account, as well as drastically improved the look and experience of
    their Android app.  The ubiquity of Dropbox clients is still it's biggest
    selling point, and the reason why I gladly pay for a larger storage quota.
