**Update:**
ZNC to Notifo has been renamed to [ZNC Push][], and given support for multiple push
notifications services, including [Boxcar][] and [Prowl][].  Please update your links
to the new [ZNC Push][] page.

ZNC to Notifo is a module for [ZNC][] that will send notifications to a [Notifo][] account
for any private message or channel highlight that matches a configurable set of conditions,
including the user's `/away` status, time since the last notification, number of clients
connected to ZNC, and more.

The module is released under the MIT license, and the source code and documentation can be
found on the project's [Github repository][github] page.
