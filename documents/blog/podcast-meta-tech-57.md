I joined [Pascal Hartig][passy] on the [Meta Tech Podcast][mtp],
[episode #57][ep], to talk about Fixit, the new open source linter
I've been working on, how and where Python is used at Meta, and how
the Python Language Foundation team supports thousands of engineers,
data scientists, AI/ML researchers, and anyone else who uses Python
to get their work done.
