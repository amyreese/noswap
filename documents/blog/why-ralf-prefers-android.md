Along a similar vein as my previous post on [Why I Prefer Android][wipa],
Ralf Rottmann, a self-described "Apple fanboy", has described why I prefer
Android better than I could in my own words:

> The latest version of Android outshines the latest version of iOS in almost
> every single aspect. **I find it to be better in terms of the performance,
> smoothness of the rendering engine, cross-app and OS level integration,
> innovation across the board, look & feel customizability and variety of the
> available apps.**

On the topic of app and system integration:

> Another great example: Sharing stuff on social networks. On iOS, I have to
> rely on the developers again. Flipboard, as one of the better examples,
> gives me the ability to directly share with Google+, Twitter and Facebook.
> On my Nexus 4, I have 20+ options. That is, because *every* app I install can
> register as a sharing provider. It’s a core feature of the Android operating
> system.

> ...

> All of this is entirely impossible on iOS today. I’ve stopped counting how
> often I felt annoyed because I clicked a link to a location in Mobile Safari
> and would have loved the Google Maps app to launch. Instead, Apple’s own Maps
> app is hardcoded into the system. And there’s no way for me to change it.

Regarding possibilities for app developers:

> On iOS, many things I always wished to see being developed, simply cannot be
> done because of the strict sandbox Apple enforces around apps.

> ...

> I also have apps [on Android] that give me great insight into the use of
> mobile data across the device and all apps. Or the battery consumption.
> Or which apps talk home and how frequently.

> None of it is available for iOS. And possibly won’t be at any time in the
> near future.

And summing up the way I've felt for a long time when using iOS devices:

> ... whenever I grab my iPhone for testing purposes, iOS feels pretty old,
> outdated and less user friendly. *For me, there currently is no way of going
> back. Once you get used to all of these capabilities, it’s hard to live
> without them.*

There are many things Apple got right with iOS, like making a consistent user
experience, and encouraging users to spend money in the market for quality apps.
But when they place so many restrictions and limitations on how you can use your
phone, and what your software is allowed to do on your own device, I gladly
give up those things that make iOS so great for the freedom to run apps that
can do what I want -- and expect -- from a modern computing device.
