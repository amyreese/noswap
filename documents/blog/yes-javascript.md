Armin Ronacher, on Firefox's [removal][] of the option to disable Javascript:

> My immediate response to change of removing the switch was:
> “Thank god, that should have happened ages ago”.

> You don't get extra privacy by disabling JavaScript. I can fully track you

> experience through better written JavaScript code that allows me to do things
> with your browser that plain HTML does not allow. 

If you're really paranoid about your privacy, use [Firefox][], enable the
[Do Not Track][] flag in your options, enable [click to play][] for plugins
like Flash or Silverlight, and install the [Ghostery][] and [Adblock][]
extensions.  Anything else is just going to break the web at your own expense.
