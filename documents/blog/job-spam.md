Things that make it obvious that your "job offer" is just a piece of spam you're throwing at the
wall to see what sticks:

* Saying you found my resume on Monster.com or some other job site when I have never ever
  registered or even visited the site in question.

* Saying you found my resume on a site I *did* sign up for, and then blatently ignoring that my
  account is marked as "not willing to relocate" and offering me a job in backwater Arkansas,
  Montana, Tennessee, or South Dakota.  There is exactly one place I want to relocate to, and that
  is the west coast.

* Requiring knowledge in technologies that aren't even mentioned in passing on my resume.

* Looking for "Rock Start" software engineers to join a start-up.

* Advertising your start-up with a bullet point of "e-commerce... e-commerce... e-commerce".

* Having your offer email include a footnote saying "Message sent with an unregistered version
  of MailList King!".  Nothing says legitimate like a recruiter who uses an unregistered piece of
  spam software.

Sigh...
