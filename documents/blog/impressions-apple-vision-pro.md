## The Preorder

Waking up at 5am sucks. Why does Apple insist on such ridiculous preorder times for
a device that's only on sale in the US? 9am PST feels like it could have been the
perfect compromise.

For iPhones, we have the ability to prepare, select, and save our preferred setups
a week ahead of time. When purchasing a device requires a face scan, an eye prescription
check, and a selection of storage space, why weren't we able to prepare all of that
ahead of time?

After much struggling, I managed to arrange an in-store pickup slot for Saturday
evening. I was extremely frustrated and disappointed to miss out on a launch day slot,
but shipping estimates were already booked out a week further. I originally preordered
a 256GB model, but almost immediately regretted that choice for fear of the unknown.

The morning of my pickup, I was able to find an opening for a 512GB model at a slightly
further away store. I took the opportunity, and canceled the original order only after
having my unit in hand.

## The Pickup

I opted for a fit test rather than the full demo — I'm well versed in VR headsets by

official marketing videos from Apple. It took at least 20 minutes before I was called
back to the demo table, and then had a bit more of a wait before the fit testing unit
was brought out on the cute wooden platter. Across the table was another in-progress
demo, with a very loud customer, and a very unenthusiastic employee reading a script
from an iPhone.

Our assigned employee was thankfully very friendly and kind. The fit test was relatively
short, just long enough to try on the solo knit band, make sure the light seal was the
right size, and run through the eye tracking setup. After giving the okay, it was
another few minutes wait while my order was put together in the back and brought out.

### Comfort

Comfort — or lack thereof — is the number one problem with the Vision Pro.

On its own, the Solo Knit band is insufficient for anything beyond reclining to watch
a movie. I could make do in a pinch if I needed, but the pressure on my forehead and
especially on my cheeks is quickly unbearable when sitting upright.

The Vision Pro also comes with the Dual Loop strap, which on its face should be more
comfortable, and yet it's still not good enough. I tried adjusting it many times,
with varying levels of fit and tightness, but with my
