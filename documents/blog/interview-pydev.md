This week, [I was interviewed](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2018/04/30/pydev-of-the-week-john-reese/)
by Mike Driscoll of [Mouse vs Python](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org)
for their "PyDev of the Week" series, focusing on developers in the Python
community.

A short quote, and timely announcement:

> Iâ€™m currently preparing a talk for PyCon 2018 on using asyncio with
> multiprocessing for highly-parallel monitoring and/or scraping workloads.
> To go with this talk, Iâ€™m working on some simple example code that I hope
> to publish on Github. This will be my first major conference talk, so Iâ€™m
> both excited and absolutely terrified! ðŸ˜…

I'm looking forward to giving that talk, and will post a video here afterwards!
