My name is Amethyst.

I am a trans woman â€”Â wife, cat mom, daughter, and sister. This is who I am.

- You can call me "Amy" if you'd like.
- Please use she/they pronouns when referring to me.
- Please do not use my old name, even when talking about past me or past events.
- Please do not ask personal questions about my transition.

I started this journey over four years ago, but the difficult parts have only just begun.
I greatly appreciate all of your love and support.

Thank you! ðŸ’œ
