A week ago today, I gave a talk at PyCon Australia in Sydney.  I discussed refactoring
in Python, and how to build refactoring tools using nothing but the standard library,
building up from concepts to syntax trees to how the **lib2to3** module works.  The talk
finished with the announcement of the open source refactoring framework I built at
Facebook, [Bowler](https://pybowler.io), which I built using those same concepts.
I really appreciated the questions from the audience and in the halls afterwards, and
we really enjoyed our time in Sydney.  Thanks to everyone that made PyCon so great!
