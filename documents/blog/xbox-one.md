Soren Johnson, lead designer of Civilization 4:

> The answer is to make digital games so attractive that players will abandon

> Microsoft could have avoided this whole fiasco by maintaining the old
> disc-based ecosystem while softly undermining it with three moves that
> create an alternate digital future.

> ...

> Combined, these three changes would destroy the traditional retail market.
> The $40 price would make digital games cheaper at release; the ongoing heavy
> sales would undercut the used games market; and persistence would make digital
> games easier to maintain across multiple devices. Microsoft needs to make
> buying games digitally a better deal for the consumer than buying them
> physically.

I was extremely disappointed to hear Microsoft cave in to rabid demands to
maintain the status quo.  I was really looking forward to their plans for
combined physical and digital ownership, where I could get all the benefits of
buying physical copies, including special and collectors' editions of my
favorite titles, while simultaneously retaining all the benefits of a digital
copy, like the ability to forego disc-swapping.

How long will we have to wait for consoles to catch up with Steam?
