This past Friday, I presented a talk at PyCon US 2018 – the first time I've
been fortunate enough to attend.  The talk was focused on achieving high
performance from modern Python services through the use of AsyncIO and the
multiprocessing modules.  The turnout was better than I could have ever
expected, and I was really happy to hear from everyone that stopped by the
Facebook booth to ask questions, discuss Facebook engineering practices, or
even just say "hello".  Thank you to everyone who made my first PyCon amazing!
