Paul Stamatiou, on falling in love with Android:

> I set out to write an article about how I feel Android provides unique
> affordances that create a unique cohesive mobile experience (more on that
> below) rather than talking openness, features and apps. However, the more
> time I spent living with Android it became obvious that being able to do
> anything and suit a variety of needs is a pillar of the Android experience.

<!> 

> I was trying to find out *why* Android felt so remarkably different to use,
> beyond aesthetics. I found there are a few pieces that help contribute to
> this magical user experience: the **global back button, intents and
> Google Now.**

<!> 

> **Delight**. It's what designers strive to produce in the experiences they
> craft. Google Now has hit the nail on the head. I can't even count the
> number of times friends have pulled out their phone to show me the smart
> things Google Now did for them.
>
> Using Android feels like one fluid experience.

And it just keeps getting better and better!
