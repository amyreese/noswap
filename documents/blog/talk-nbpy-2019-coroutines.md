Back in 2019–remember the before times?–I gave a talk at North Bay Python 2019
on the topics of coroutines, AsyncIO, and how they work. It's a crazy journey
from bytecode and runtime instructions to building our own terrible event loop
in pure Python using nothing but generators and tears. Enjoy!

And if that was too slow, don't miss the [shorter rendition of this talk][pyca]
that I gave at PyCascades 2020, right before COVID ruined everything.
