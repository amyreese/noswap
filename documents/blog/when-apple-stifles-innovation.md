John Gruber recently talked about
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/11/flagging_messages_from_iphone_mail">how he deals with email on the iPhone</a>,
where Apple's Mail tool lacks the ability to do something even as simple as
flag a message in the inbox.  He has go through a convoluted process of moving
email to a specially-named folder, and then running a bit of AppleScript on his
desktop that will take all the mail from the special folder, flag them, and move
them back to the desktop.  Good grief.

Why again does John need to go through this long, redirection process?  Why not
just use a different email client on the iPhone?  Because
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/09/app_store_exclusion">Apple is anti-competitive</a>,
and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/10/in_the_background">third party apps
can't run in the background</a>, straight from John Gruber himself.

Isn't this a bit absurd?  Why do people let Apple stifle competition like this?
Am I the only one that thinks this situation is far worse than anything presented
in the huge anti-trust cases against Microsoft in the past decade?  Apple is
<em>specifically denying</em> competition on the iPhone, and all the groupies
think that it's perfectly acceptable, even good for the consumer!  But shame on
Microsoft for bundling Internet Exploder and a Media Player; how dare they allow
anyone to choose a different browser even!

People ask me why I purchased my Neo Freerunner instead of an iPhone.  Even
disregarding that I'd lose my choice of carrier, I don't see why people are rushing
to a company that depends on anti-competitive practices to maintain the 'best'
apps on the phone.  If Apple's browser, mail reader, etc, don't suit the customers'
needs (as is apparent from Gruber's post), why are they trying to stop them choosing
a better option?  It's not like Apple's revenues depend on users choosing Safari
or Mail.app;  hell, wouldn't they get even more revenues from the App Store if
people could buy a superior browser for even $1 a pop?

Sounds to me like Apple cares more about maintaining control than providing their
users with the best experience....
