It's no secret that I'm a huge fan of space, video games, or video games set
in space.  I was a very early backer of [Star Citizen][], and am still eagerly
awaiting the release of the persistent universe.  But I also backed
[Elite: Dangerous][] as well, and although the initial scope was far more
limited than Star Citizen's, Elite has already seen a "1.0" release, and I've
been playing it an awful lot, all the way up from the first beta.

And damn, it's good!

The discipline and focus of the team at Frontier Development has produced one
of the most polished space sim games I've ever played, and while there are
plenty of gaps in features compared to the competition, everything that's there
is done so well that I continue to be impressed every time I get in that cockpit
and launch into the void.

After putting dozens of hours into the final release, I've gathered a few
notes here that will hopefully help others in their journies to the stars.
I will attempt to keep this up to date for as long as I'm playing the game.

### Tools

- [Thrudd's Trading Tool][thrudd] - This is a must-have tool for checking
  prices of goods at stations around the galaxy.  It allows you to plan trade
  runs, find the nearest or cheapest source of goods, and much more.  The data
  is maintained by users, and it can import data from [EliteOCR][] so that you
  can update prices without manually entering all the values.

- [Elite Shipyard][] - This is an excellent tool for planning ship purchases
  or upgrades.  You can plug in any combinations of upgrades and equipment
  possible, and see how that impacts your ship's mass, jump range, insurance
  costs, and more.  Can also generate permalinks to save or share your ship
  configurations.

- [Elite Rare Trader][] - This is an interactive tool for planning rare goods
  trading routes, including calculation of jump distances between systems, and
  optimal selling locations for each rare product.

- [CMDR Club Routes][CMDR Club] - Great tool for planning jump routes beyond
  the 100LY limit of in-game galaxy map.  I generally use this to find
  midpoints on long journies that are about 60LY apart, so that I can still
  use the galaxy map for plotting routes so that I don't need to manually
  target the next jump each time, but without needing to wait forever for it
  to map jumps out to 100LY.

### Tips

-   If you're flying a Sidewinder, Hauler, Adder, or anything else with less
    than 40 tons of cargo space, one of the best ways to make money trading
    is by hauling rare goods.  Buy the rare goods, and sell them at a station
    140LY away for maximum profit.  Exploit "clusters" of rare goods to make
    trading runs worth upwards of 1.5M credits per round trip.  And keep in
    mind that an empty cargo slot is worth up to 20k credits; make sure
    you have a full hold before you travel 140LY.

    A good, simple route is between the Lave and 39 Tauri clusters.
    My personal route makes the following stops, selling all goods at the
    first stop of each cluster:

    Cluster 1: Orrere -> Lave -> Leesti -> Diso.  
    Cluster 2: Wolf 1301 -> Fujin -> 39 Tauri -> George Pantazis.

    If you have a small cargo capacity, like on the Sidewinder or Adder, you
    could likely get away with just going back and forth between Leesti and
    Fujin, with an occasional stop in 39 Tauri if Fujin doesn't have enough
    to fill your cargo bay.

-   When plotting routes in the galaxy map, switch to Fastest Route mode.
    It uses a "depth-first" search, rather than breadth-first, and can easily
    plot routes out to 60LY in 15-20 seconds, compared to 30-45 seconds for
    the same route in "Most Economical".  You'll expend more fuel, but the
    time saved in making fewer jumps is easily worth it when you can make more
    trade runs and more profit.

-   Having a fuel scoop is a great way to save both money and time when making
    several long-range journies, such as when hauling rare goods.  Having the
    scoop means trading a few moments sitting near the star after jumping in,
    rather than several minutes traveling to the nearest station and docking
    every time you start running low.  I personally find the 2B rated scoop to
    have the best price-to-speed ratio for any ship up to the Type 7.
    **Scoop fuel while plotting routes to save even more time.**

-   Class D thrusters are faster/better than class C, for pretty much all ships.
    ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/2s6lpi/thruster_testing_results/))

-   When trying to maximize jump range, class D equipment weighs significantly
    less than any other class rating.  Conversely, class B equipment weighs the
    most of all class ratings, and should generally be avoided.  The FSD is
    the only piece of equipment where every single class level is a clear win
    over the previous rating in terms of jump range.

-   When getting interdicted, there is almost no upside to fighting it.  Reduce
    throttle to idle, and "submit" to the interdiction.  You will prevent any
    hull damage from "losing" the interdiction, and your FSD cooldown will only
    be 10 seconds, instead of 40, meaning you'll have a far better chance of
    escaping back into supercruise than if you'd fought and lost.
