title: My Setup
description: A rundown of the hardware and software that I use for both work and play.
date: 2023-12-24
tags: me, gear

---

I am a software engineer by nature, and I focus on building tools for other
developers, both for my employer and for personal, open source projects.
I work full-time remote, and spend most of my time on a Mac, but I also support
developers on every major OS.

In my free time I play a lot of video games, on a variety of platforms, but
I have strong opinions about which ones are "best". I have done my best to keep
gaming-specific items in a separate section.

I'm grateful and privileged to be well employed and capable of buying quality
gear. I appreciate that not everyone can afford such luxuries. I hope that
someday the world will have enough social safety nets and universal benefits
that everyone could have the same opportunities. #unionize

<a name="hardware"></a>
### Hardware

<a name="computers"></a>
Computers

- [Mac Mini](https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/)
  (M1, 16GB, 2TB)
  --
  My everyday machine for personal projects, browsing the web, and pretty much
  anything else. Perhaps the best value Mac I've ever purchased.

    - [CalDigit TS3 Thunderbolt Dock](https://www.caldigit.com/ts3-plus/)

- [iPad Pro 11"](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/)
  (M2, 128GB, Silver)
  --
  Media consumption device, "on the go" Mac replacement, and drawing tablet.
  I've even given successful presentations with it.
  Absolutely love this thing.

    - [Apple Pencil 2nd Gen](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/)
    - [Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/ipad-keyboards/) (Black)
    - [Smart Folio for iPad Air (5th Gen)](https://www.apple.com/shop/ipad/accessories) (Lavender)

- [iPhone 15 Pro](https://www.apple.com/iphone-15-pro/)
  (128GB, White Titanium)
  --
  I miss the iPhone 13 Mini, but USB-C and optical 2X/3X zoom are too tempting.
  Converted me to the caseless PopSocket lifestyle thanks to its size
  and weight. I'd pay _even more_ for an iPhone Pro Mini.

    - [PopGrip for MagSafe](https://www.popsockets.com/en-us/more/grips/magsafe)
      (Pill shape, translucent purple)


<a name="desk"></a>
Desk

- [Uplift V2 Standing Desk](https://www.upliftdesk.com/standing-desks/)
  (60" C-Frame, ash grey)
  --
  Sturdy and high quality desk. Mounted a pair of Ikea wireframe underside
  cable organizers from my previous desk.

- [Herman Miller Aeron Chair](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/)
  (~2019, Graphite, size C)
  --
  Ergonomic, sturdy, dependable. Bought it from a local business liquidation
  outlet when I went full-time remote, and I haven't regretted it once.

- [Dell UP2718Q](https://i.dell.com/sites/csdocuments/Product_Docs/en/dell_ultrasharp_27_4k_hdr_monitor_up2718q_product_spec_sheet.pdf)
  (27", 4K, HDR10, 60Hz)
  --
  The only monitor I've found with HDR up to 1000nits with local dimming and
  four full-speed inputs. I'd love a 5K or 6K version for proper retina
  resolution, but as far as I can tell, Dell doesn't even sell a monitor
  that matches this feature set, five years later. However, image retention
  is getting worse with time, especially on the left-most edge.
  If Apple made an HDR monitor with multiple inputs, I'd switch in a heartbeat.

    - [Jarvis Monitor Arm](https://store.hermanmiller.com/office-furniture-desk-accessories-organization/jarvis-single-monitor-arm/2548325.html)

- [Sonos Ray](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/ray) + [Sub Mini](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sub-mini)
  --
  A great, small soundbar that fits behind/under my monitor.
  Connected to my Mac Mini via optical cable through a TB3 dock.

- [Kinesis Freestyle Edge](https://gaming.kinesis-ergo.com/edge/)
  --
  The only compact, split layout, backlit, mechanical keyboard with a
  _flat keycap profile_. Programmable with macros, and includes ten custom
  keys on the left side, while the right side layout is extra compact so that
  my mouse can be as close to natural position as possible. Rearranged the
  keycaps to the Dvorak layout, [of course](https://noswap.com/blog/dvorak).

- [Logitech MX Anywhere 3S](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-anywhere-3s.910-006927.html)
  --
  Excellent mouse for smaller hands or shorter fingers. Use the RF dongle
  whenever possible for best response and lowest latency, but it can be
  paired to three separate dongles or bluetooth devices, perfect for use at
  a desk or on the go with a laptop or iPad.

- [AIMOS 4 Port USB Switch](https://amzn.to/4av98Fp)
  --
  Simple USB switch for selecting which computer my keyboard and mouse are
  connected to. Far less fiddly (and cheaper) than using a KVM, especially
  when dealing with 4K HDR video. Mirrors the four inputs on my monitor.

- [Elgato Stream Deck v1](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/stream-deck-mk2-black)
  --
  Mostly used for controlling Apple Music on my Mac Mini when I'm working,
  but also includes a couple other useful shortcuts and system controls.

- [Elgato Facecam](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/facecam)
  --
  Good quality webcam that actually has a decent size sensor for indoor use.
  Lets me look reasonably good without needing a bunch of key lights shining
  in my face every time I'm in a meeting. It does not include a microphone,
  for better or worse.

- [Blue Yeti](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/streaming-gear/yeti-premium-usb-microphone.988-000103.html)
  (10th Anniversary Edition)
  --
  Bog standard condensing microphone. I've recorded a handful of podcasts and
  conference talks with this. It's not great, but it's not awful. Picks up
  a *ton* of background noise, even in it's recommended "cardioid" setting.
  Keep the gain to a minimum, or maybe just go ahead and buy a
  [better microphone](https://marco.org/podcasting-microphones).

- [Anker 637 Charging Station](https://amzn.to/4aMbn7x)
  --
  Extremely convenient charging station, with a MagSafe charger on the front,
  two USB-A and two USB-C PD charging ports on the back, and three AC outlets,
  which are perfect for powering ad-hoc devices like a laptop or my
  [race seat](#raceseat).


<a name="headphones"></a>
Headphones

- [Sony WH-1000XM4](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/wh1000xm4-s)
  (Silver)
  --
  Bluetooth ANC over-ear headphones. They sound great, but most importantly
  they are extremely comfortable for long listening sessions, something I can't
  say about most other headphones I've tried.

- [Sony INZONE H9](https://www.sony.com/lr/electronics/gaming-headsets-headphones/inzone-h9)
  --
  Wireless USB over-ear gaming headphones that actually support ANC and
  _simultaneous_ mixing of bluetooth audio. Lets me play and hear audio from
  my games _while also_ listening to podcasts from my phone. Compatible with
  PC and PS5. Weirdly, it only works with the Steamdeck when connected through
  a dedicated USB-C hub.

- [Apple AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/)
  --
  The only in-ear headphones I've ever been able to stand wearing for more than
  30 seconds. Mostly used when doing chores or listening on the go.


<a name="tv"></a>
TV

- [LG C2 OLED 65"](https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled65c2pua-oled-4k-tv)
  --
  Probably the best TV on the market for the money. Looks great, _mostly_
  untouched by adware, and I have never once connected it to the internet lest
  it get worse by design.

- [Apple TV 4K](https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-4k/)
  --
  The least worst streaming box available. The remote is amazing, but I wish
  it had one or two extra buttons on it. On the bedroom TV remote, I've remapped
  the "mute" button to the TV's "sleep" button, for obvious reasons.

- [Sonos Arc](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/arc) + [Sub](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sub)
  --
  The best soundbar I've ever heard, paired with a great subwoofer.
  Excellent integration with the TV and Apple TV when set up using HDMI eARC.


<a name="home"></a>
Home

- [Unifi CloudKey+](https://techspecs.ui.com/unifi/cameras-nvrs/unifi-cloudkey-plus)
  --
  A simple PoE network video recorder with a single internal drive bay.
  Records 24/7 video from each camera, but also integrates into Homekit
  through Homebridge for motion events. Replaced the 1TB spinning rust
  with a 4TB SSD. No subscription needed!

- [Unifi G4 Instant](https://techspecs.ui.com/unifi/cameras-nvrs/camera-g4-instant)
  --
  A basic 2K wifi camera with good picture quality, even at night.

- [Logitech Circle View Doorbell](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/cameras/circle-view-video-doorbell.html)
  --
  The least worst hardwired Homekit doorbell I've tried.

- [Lutron Caseta smart switches](https://www.casetawireless.com/us/en/products)
  --
  Hands down the best and most reliable smart switches around.
  Requires a dedicated hub, but the Homekit integration is flawless.
  We now have these in the kitchen, the living room, the bedroom, and their
  outdoor weatherproof version for controlling holiday lights. 

- [Philips Hue smart bulbs](https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us)
  --
  For lamps where a smart switch is not an option. Also requires a dedicated
  hub, but the Homekit integration can be a bit fiddly, and the bulbs are *way*
  more expensive to replace. Offers some interesting lighting arrangements,
  like lighting strips and ambiance lights.

- [Synology DS916+](https://www.synology.com/en-us/products?product_line=ds_plus)
  <a name="nas"></a>
  --
  Four bay NAS with quadcore Intel CPU, powerful enough for streaming and
  encoding video through [Plex](#plex). Mostly used for storing movies and
  TV shows that I've ripped from DVDs or Blurays.


<a name="travel"></a>
Travel

- [GL iNet Beryl AX](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-mt3000/)
  --
  Travel router. Plug in to ethernet or bridge to hotel WiFi, and only log
  in to the captive once. Every other device now transparently shares the same
  "connection", resolving incompatibilities like with the Nintendo Switch.


<a name="software"></a>
### Software / Services

<a name="everyday"></a>
Everyday

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
  --
  The only one that doesn't hate you or your privacy.
  Sending tabs from my phone to my desktop for later viewing is magical.
  Available everywhere.

- [Fastmate](https://github.com/joelekstrom/fastmate)
  --
  Native wrapper for the [Fastmail](https://ref.fm/u25545864) web client.
  Good enough in a world of snoozing and other advanced features, although
  I miss the simplicity and speed which I could manage my inbox with
  [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/).

- [1Password](https://1password.com/)
  --
  Least worst cross-platform password manager that anyone can (and should) use.

- [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical)
  --
  Excellent native calendaring app with fantastic widgets.
  Works with iCloud and other accounts, and the natural language processing is
  👩‍🍳💋. "Nails fri 3pm at 123 main st" will create an event named "Nails" for
  Friday at 3PM, and set the location to "123 Main St". Extremely useful for
  quick inputs when setting appointments in person.

- [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/)
  --
  My favorite Mastodon client (so far) mostly because it maintains most of the
  sensibilities from the best third-party Twitter clients.  The Mac client is
  ... good enough, but the iOS app is clearly what gets the most attention.
  I will forever miss [Twitterrific for Mac](https://twitterrific.com/mac/).

- [Notability](https://notability.com/)
  --
  Hybrid drawing and markup app, best used on an iPad with the Pencil.
  I mostly use it for filling out or signing PDF forms, but sometimes it's nice
  to draw diagrams or make notes related to games I'm playing.

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
  --
  My favorite markdown editor and notes app all-in-one.
  Isn't afraid to get nerdy; has a Vim mode. Endless settings screen.

- [Overcast](https://overcast.fm)
  --
  The podcast app who's developer is not afraid to take the time to get it right.
  Smart Speed and Voice Boost were invented here.

- [Parcel](https://parcel.app/)
  --
  Package delivery tracking. Clean interface, with a strong list of supported
  carriers.

- [Reeder](https://www.reederapp.com/)
  --
  My favorite RSS feed reader app. Clean, good looking three column layout
  with great fonts, and it works really well on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
  Syncs using [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) or similar service.
  Includes a simple "read later" queue that gets synced via iCloud.

- [Soulver](https://soulver.app/)
  --
  Math playground; calculator and notepad with live answers and variables.
  Great for unit conversions and multi-step calculations with editable history.
  You have to try it to understand.


<a name="engineering"></a>
Engineering

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
  --
  The best native terminal for macOS with powerful features, like
  "smart selection" to treat predictable text patterns or identifiers
  (eg, "D1234") as clickable links to their canonical URLs.

- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
  --
  The standard. Taught me the magic of modal editing.
  Don't ask me about emacs; my wrists are still swollen from college.

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  --
  The de facto IDE for Python developers. Includes a decent Vim mode.

    - [µfmt](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=omnilib.ufmt)
      --
      Safe, atomic formatting and import sorting for Python.


<a name="music"></a>
Music

- [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com)
  --
  Decent music streaming service. Pays artists more than Spotify does.
  Lets you import your own MP3s (like from Bandcamp or CD) and treat them
  like songs and albums from their streaming catalog.

- [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com)
  --
  Buy music directly from indie artists while you still can.
  Download the MP3s for those albums while you still can.

- [Last.fm](https://last.fm)
  --
  Independent (and free) service for keeping track of the music you've listened
  to over time. Requires using an app to "scrobble" tracks as they play.
  Still has my entire play history from when I started using it
  [all the way back in 2006](https://www.last.fm/user/n7cmdr/library).

- [Longplay](https://longplay.rocks/)
  --
  View and play your Apple Music collection as albums, not tracks.
  My new favorite music listening app of all time.
  Scrobbles to Last.fm.

- [Marvis](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/marvis-pro/id1447768809)
  --
  Alternative iOS app for managing and playing your Apple Music collection.
  My go-to for playlists or shuffle mode.
  Scrobbles to Last.fm.

- [MusicHarbor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicharbor-track-new-music/id1440405750)
  --
  Stay on top of new and upcoming releases from artist you care about.
  One-touch add to library or a default playlist.

- [NepTunes](https://micropixels.software/apps/neptunes)
  --
  Mac menu bar app to display current track name and scrobble music to Last.fm.


<a name="video"></a>
Video

- [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/)
  --
  Good service and app for tracking and rating movies you've seen.
  I don't watch movies [very often](https://letterboxd.com/n7amy/films/diary/),
  but I enjoy taking time to reflect on them and rate them when I do.

- [Plex](https://plex.tv)
  <a name="plex"></a>
  -- 
  Host your own streaming service using your own library of media files.
  This is where all of my local "backups" of movies and TV shows go so that
  I can watch them from anywhere on any device at any time.
  Does an excellent job at curating and presenting your directory of files, but
  it requires running a local server — I run it on my [NAS](#nas).
  I bought the lifetime subscription pass back in 2014 and never looked back.

- [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/)
  --
  Service for tracking TV shows and episodes. Makes it easy to keep a record
  of which seasons and episodes you've seen and where you left off.
  Also supports movies, but [I use it](https://trakt.tv/users/n7cmdr) only for
  shows. Best paired with an app like Watcht or Sequel.

- [Watcht](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/watcht-for-trakt/id1396920723)
  --
  Great app for Trakt to view your currently active TV shows, what shows or
  episodes you have available to watch, and what episodes are airing soon.
  Having your "up next" queue right there on the home dashboard is perfect.


<a name="utilities"></a>
Utilities

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
  --
  Launcher and so much more.

- [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12)
  --
  Caffeine for modern macOS.

- [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/)
  --
  Keeps menu bar apps under control.

- [DaisyDisk](https://daisydiskapp.com/)
  --
  Simple and good looking app to analyze storage space.

- [IINA](https://iina.io/)
  --
  Streamlined video player. What VLC should have always been.

- [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/)
  --
  Menu bar resource monitor. CPU, RAM, disk, network, and more.

- [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/)
  --
  No frills window manager with splits and quadrents. 

- [Middle](https://middleclick.app/)
  --
  Adds a proper middle click gesture to Apple touchpads.

- [Pastebot](https://tapbots.com/pastebot/)
  --
  Simple clipboard manager with advanced features. 

- [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/)
  --
  Emoji picker for every app, à la Discord or Slack. "Boosters" include ASCII
  gems like ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

- [SoundSource](https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/)
  --
  Advanced, nit-picky control of audio levels and output devices.

- [SteerMouse](https://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/index.html)
  --
  Configurable, alternative mouse driver for Logitech and other brands.
  Removes the need to use Logitech's invasive, awful driver software.



<a name="gaming"></a>
### Gaming

<a name="consoles"></a>
Consoles

- [Corsair One i200](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/c/gaming-computers/corsair-one)
  (Intel i9 10900K, Nvidia 2080Ti, 32GB)
  --
  An excellent, liquid-cooled all-in-one gaming PC. Compact and quiet,
  with a desktop footprint no bigger than a Mac Studio or Xbox Series X.
  Since upgraded to a 2TB NVMe with a 2TB SSD for each extra storage.

- [Playstation 5](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/)
  (Disc model)
  --
  Used almost exclusively for playing Gran Turismo. On my desk so that I can
  use it with my race seat. Installed the matte black side panels from DBrand.

    - [dbrand darkplates](https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/ps5)
      -- matte black everything

- [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-neon-blue-neon-red-joy-con-117972/)
  (Blue+Red launch edition)
  --
  Zelda, Mario, Kirby, and not much else.

- [Xbox Series X](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/xbox-series-x)
  --
  It's an Xbox hooked up to the TV.

- [Steamdeck OLED](https://www.steamdeck.com/en/oled)
  (Special Edition, 1TB)
  --
  For PC gaming on the go, or when I want to be on the couch. Excellent screen
  panel, but it's a shame it's not higher resolution.

    - [Steamdeck Dock](https://www.steamdeck.com/en/dock)
      --
      Great for playing PC games on the TV.


<a name="vr"></a>
VR

- [Quest Pro](https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-pro/)
  --
  My preferred VR headset for pretty much everything, but especially for
  simulators. The visuals are high quality, the internal tracking is flawless,
  and the controllers are fantastic. Added an aftermarket side-to-side head
  strap to help keep weight and pressure off my forehead, making it the most
  comfortable headset I've ever used. Most frequently used with the Link cable
  below to play driving and flight simulators.

    - [Quest Link Cable](https://www.meta.com/quest/accessories/link-cable/)
      --
      Connects a Quest headset to my gaming PC so that I can play PC VR games on
      the newer Quest headsets. Significantly better experience than trying to
      use AirLink, even with the dedicated wifi dongle.

- [Playstation VR2](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps-vr2/)
  --
  My newest VR headset, but not my favorite. Visual quality is not as good as
  the Quest Pro, and the controllers belong in a trash can. Like my PS5, this
  is almost exclusively used for Gran Turismo, which thankfully supports the
  standard PS5 controller and the steering wheel in VR.


<a name="controllers"></a>
Controllers

- [Xbox Elite Series 2](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/elite-wireless-controller-series-2)
  --
  Modern Xbox controllers have the best ergonomics on the market, and this is
  easily the best of the bost. The hair triggers are excellent, and the build
  quality is second to none. Strong recommend.

- [NYXI Wizard Joy-pad](https://nyxigame.com/pages/nyxi-wizard-series)
  --
  A better Joy-con for the Switch, with classic Gamecube layout and hall-effect
  sensors in the joysticks. HE sensors should be mandatory these days, but this
  pair goes above and beyond with a layout that doesn't confuse my brain every
  time I jump between the Switch and the Xbox.

- [Playseat Challenge](https://playseatamerica.com/collections/racing-1/products/playseat%C2%AE-challenge-actifit)
  <a name="raceseat"></a>
  --
  Compact, foldable race seat. Fits in a closet, even with the wheel and pedals
  attached. Trivial to set up or put away in 2-3 minutes, perfect for playing
  a driving sim at a moment's notice.

- [Fanatec Gran Turismo DD-Pro](https://fanatec.com/us-en/racing-wheels-direct-drive-bases/racing-wheels/gran-turismo-dd-pro-5-nm)
  --
  Excellent mid-range wheel and pedal setup. Direct drive force-feedback is
  practically a must for modern racing sims, and this is one hell of an upgrade
  from the [Logitech G29](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/driving/driving-force-racing-wheel.html)
  that most folks start with. Do yourself a favor and get the load cell brake
  pedal -- it's a bit weird at first, but provides a much better experience.

- Virpil HOTAS
  --
  High quality joystick and throttle for every flight (or space) simulator.
  Requires buying a set of pieces, but that does offer a choice of alternative
  layouts or features. The pieces I selected include:

    - [VPC WarBRD base](https://virpil-controls.eu/vpc-warbrd-d-base.html)
    - [VPC Constellation ALPHA-R grip](https://virpil-controls.eu/vpc-constellation-alpha-r.html)
    - [VPC MongoosT-50CM3 throttle](https://virpil-controls.eu/vpc-mongoost-50cm3-throttle.html)
